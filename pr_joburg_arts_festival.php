		 		<h4>The Brief</h4>
		 		<p>Dreamcatcher was appointed to execute PR for the 46664 Johannesburg fundraising concert, an initiative of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund.
Set for December 1, World Aids Day, and featuring a mix of local and international talent,  the concert was jointly an HIV/AIDS awareness raising  activity as well as  a fundraiser for the Children’s Fund.<br><br>
As the event publicists, our brief was to deliver PR that created awareness both about the concert and the cause it was supporting.
We were brought onto the project six weeks before the show date, thus time was of the essence, and every media intervention had to be high-impact.

</p>
<div class="spacing"></div>
		 		<h4>Our Response</h4>
		 		<p>We identified the following factors as the key communication drivers:
                <ul class="list-group">
<li>‘It’s in your hands’ - the 46664 slogan – impressed upon audiences that supporting the concert was a contribution to the fight against HIV/Aids.  </li>
<li>That the concert was an initiative by Madiba.  </li>
<li>The A-list local and international artist line-up confirmed to perform</li>
<li>This was the first 46664 concert ever to take place in South Africa</li>
</ul>

</p> 
<p>The PR action plan rolled out as follows: 
<ul class="list-group">
<li>Staggered announcements: initially, only the concert was announced; a month later the local line-up, and a week subsequently the international line-up was revealed. 
</li>
<li>Each announcement was followed by an intense round of interviews with the concert’s producers and artists. 
</li>
<li>Photo opportunities were set up on a regular basis: of the artists in private rehearsal, the build-up of the stage,  etc.
</li>
<li>Press conference and photo opportunities with the full artist line-up and Nelson Mandela in attendance two days before the concert. 
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="spacing"></div>
		 		<h4>The Outcome</h4>
		 		<p>The PR strategy resulted in a high volume of media coverage across print and electronic media over the three month campaign.<br><br>
There was a consistency of coverage, split evenly across national and regional, commercial and community press. Equally importantly, the City of Johannesburg was successfully positioned as a City entity in touch with the citizenry’s needs, and the distribution of media coverage covered the various artistic genres – theatre, music, & dance. <br><br>
The PR value of the campaign was an unprecedented R49 Million (Advertising Value Equivalent, multiplied by 3).
