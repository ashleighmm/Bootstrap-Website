                <p  class="text-justify">Dreamcatcher was mandated to coordinate a seminar for SAMDA and the Department of Minerals & Energy within the Mining Federation Summit at the Electra Mining Africa Summit The purpose of the seminar was twofold – the first was for Government to interact with leaders within the mining arena, and the second was for government representatives to report back and dialogue with the SMME’s within the mining space. The Summit took place at Nasrec, and as per our brief, Dreamcatcher created an environment for high profile gathering befitting the presence of the government ministers and CEO’s of large mines on one hand, and a more traditional workshop for the report-back/dialogue session with the SMME’s, on the other. </p>

            <h4 class="h4-large margin-top-none">Launch of the Dalton Private Reserve – Tugela Municipality, Kwa Zulu Natal </h4>
               
                <p>The Dalton Private Reserve was launched in September 2008.    A project that spanned over a year-long duration, the launch was a combination of banquet dinner, game drives, a concert and a theatrical re-enactment of historical events. <br>
                    <br>
                    The guest list consisted solely of international VIP guests (captains of industry in their respective countries) who flew in from Russia, Australia, the U.K., and the U.S.A. <br>
                    <br>
                    We were committed to ensuring that the people of the Tugela region and within the Kwa Zulu Natal province  benefitted from this incredible project.  To this end, we enlisted the services of a range of service providers who collaborated with locals to deliver the services required.  The companies and services in question include: <br>
                    <br>
                    Eager Artists – a Durban-based  choreography company, headed up by world renowned artistic director, Jerry Pooe who worked with and trained members of the local community to deliver the theatrical historical reenactment. </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">The Africa Economic Expansion Summit of November 2014 appointed Dreamcatcher as producer, just two months prior to the event. A lack of event experience led the clients to request that we take the lead on most aspects of this massive project. The conference would be over 3 days at the Durban ICC, include opening and closing ceremonies, a gala dinner, 2 cocktail dinners, 3 sponsored lunches, over 100(!) presentations, nearly 150 foreign patrons, +20 international speakers, and an exhibition, not to mention numerous local dignitaries ranging from the CEOs of Top 100 companies to world-renowned experts, and Ministerial representation. </p>

                  <p class="text-justify">The Heads of State Retreat was a private dinner for the 5 BRICS Heads of State accompanied by their core teams. This took place at Zimbali Resort in Ballito and the event was also attended by over 200 Diplomats, political principals as well as high ranking government officials.<br><br>

The BRICS BUSSINESS LOUNGE (BBL) was initially incorporated into the BRICS Summit planning by DIRCO in order to give the sizable business delegations that will accompany the Heads of State, the opportunity to network and interact. Once sponsors were brought in, it then became a platform for the sponsors to also invite their guests and use it as an extended networking platform
<br><br>
Over 250 high profile guests, ranging from ministers, ambassadors & other diplomats as well as top SA business people attended the event. The BBL served as a cocktail function prior to the main event, the cultural opening ceremony.</p>
