                <h4>The Brief</h4>
                <p>S.A. Tourism (SAT) briefed us to execute their internal tourism ‘Sho’t Left’ campaign’s launch. </p>
                <div class="spacing"></div>
                <h4>Our Response</h4>
                <p>We scheduled it for the morning to ensure that journalists would have time to file stories. “Emoyeni” venue, overlooking Jhb, was our choice. To inject a celebratory atmosphere, the event was conceived as a champagne breakfast. Guests were ushered into a function room set up cinema-style, where a video of the campaign was played. SAT gave a brief address, after which the campaign ambassadors were revealed. </p>

                <p>Dreamcatcher was appointed to execute PR for the 46664 Johannesburg fundraising concert, an initiative of the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund.
                    Set for December 1, World Aids Day, and featuring a mix of local and international talent,  the concert was jointly an HIV/AIDS awareness raising  activity as well as  a fundraiser for the Children’s Fund.<br>

                    As the event publicists, our brief was to deliver PR that created awareness both about the concert and the cause it was supporting.
                    We were brought onto the project six weeks before the show date, thus time was of the essence, and every media intervention had to be high-impact. </p>
